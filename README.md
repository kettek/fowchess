This is a test backend/frontend for learning Elixir(backend) and Hyperscript(frontend). The project itself is a multiplayer chess that uses fog of war because why not.

## Running
Running requires [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/install.html) to be installed. Once installed, navigate to the **be** subdirectory and run `mix run --no-halt`. You can then go to `localhost:4000` to play around.
